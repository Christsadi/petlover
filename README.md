# Codecademy Petlove Project 

In this project, I had the opportunity to practice using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application. Specifically, building a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

## General Information

- Project Objectives is to add client-side routing to the application using React Router so that:

  - he HomePage component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.
  - The PetDetailsPage page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s id.
  - The PetDetailsPage displays data for the correct pet based on the id in the URL parameters’ values.
  - When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the SearchPage, which uses the query parameter called name to filter pets by name.
  - When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a PetNotFoundPage.
  - From the PetNotFound page, users can click “Go Back” button that will take them to page they were previously on.
